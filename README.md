# Zoetrope

Zoetrope is an open-source tool created to facilitate the collection, processing, and analysis of Google Street View data across time and geographies. The tool aims to serve the diverse community of city enthusiasts, urban planners, researchers, and others interested in exploring the richness of temporal street view imagery, without having to navigate single year panoramas through manually interfacing with Google Maps and Street View. For example, a Zoetrope user can browse individual street addresses or sample from neighbourhoods to look at how an address or the neighbourhood's streetscape changes over the years, potentially identifying physical indicators of growth, gentrification, or dilapidation in recent years. 

Zoetrope was originally developed as part of the Urban Displacement Project at UC Berkeley and is currently hosted by the School of Cities at the University of Toronto. [Zoetrope's public GitHub repository](https://github.com/schoolofcities/zoetrope) is available as part of the School of Cities organization. As an open-source project, Zoetrope is also accessible for programmers seeking to adapt and customize their own Zoetrope; however, Zoetrope is not taking contributions at this time. Zoetrope creates a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve access to street view panoramas over time grabbed using the [streetview python library](https://github.com/robolyst/streetview) by Adrian Letchford and the Google Maps API.
